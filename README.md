# HardyHAR

⚠️ This work is for migrating base code generation js functionality from [HTTPSnippet](https://github.com/kong/httpsnippet) into separate lib for usage across all JS environs e.g. browser bundlers (webpack, browserify, etc.), nodejs etc. so that the core code does not rely on a CLI.

> HTTP Request snippet generator for *many* languages & tools including: `cURL`, `HTTPie`, `Javascript`, `Node`, `C`, `Java`, `PHP`, `Objective-C`, `Swift`, `Python`, `Ruby`, `C#`, `Go`, `OCaml` and [more](https://github.com/kong/httpsnippet/wiki/Targets)!

Relies on the popular [HAR](http://www.softwareishard.com/blog/har-12-spec/#request) format to import data and describe HTTP calls.
